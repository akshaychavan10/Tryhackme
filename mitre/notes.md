MITRE is non-profit Corporation and created several projects/research for the cybersecurity community like

- ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- SHIELD (sorry, not a fancy acronym) Active Defense
- AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

## Basic Terminology

**APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) :** This can be considered a team/group (threat group), or even country (nation-state group), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries.

**TTP** : (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

- The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
- The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
- The Procedure is how the technique is executed.

##  ATT&CK® Framework 

- MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

## CAR Knowledge Base 

- Cyber Analytics Repository
- It is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE.
- CAR is a great place for finding analytics that takes us further than the Mitigation and Detection summaries in the ATT&CK® framework. 

(basically it has some pseudocode to search in analytics platform like splunk or eql)

## Shield Active Defense 

- Shield is an active defense knowledge base.
- tactics and techniques provided to us enable us to trap and/or engage (with) an adversary active within the network.

## ATT&CK® Emulation Plans 

CITD : Center of Threat-Informed Defense

- MITRE formed an organization named CITD
- This organization consists of various companies and vendors from around the globe.
- Their objective is to conduct research on cyber threats and their TTPs and share this research to improve cyber defense for all. 

some vendors of CITD :
- microsoft
- splunk
- verizon

**Adversary Emulation Library**

- It is a public library making adversary emulation plans a free resource for blue/red teamers.
- ontribution from CTID.

**ATT&CK® Emulations Plans**

- three ATT&CK® Emulations Plans are there.
- APT3, APT29,FIN6
- The emulation plans are a step-by-step guide on how to mimic the specific threat group. 

##  ATT&CK® and Threat Intelligence 

- By using threat intelligence, as defenders, we can make better decisions regarding the defensive strategy.
