notes for Decoder, Comparer and Sequencer tools.

Decoder : work with encoded text; 
Comparer : compare sets of text; 
Sequencer : analyse the randomness of captured tokens.

## Decoder

we can decode information that we capture during an attack, but we can also encode data of our own

Decoder also gives us the option to generate hashsums for our entered data.
