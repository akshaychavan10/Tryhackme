Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA), 

Confidentiality : `ensures that data is only accessed by authorised people`

Organisations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.

Integrity : `ensures that data cannot be altered by unauthorised people`

information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made

Availability : 

In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.
