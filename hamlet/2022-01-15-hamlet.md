A Shakespeare/Hamlet-inspired room in which you will explore an uncommon web application used in linguistic/NLP research.

## Reconnaissance

As always start with the Nmap.

```

Here we got two http service running on web server, port 501 is open nmap doesn't ensure what service is running on that port. we also have a ftp server and ssh service running.

Lets start with the ftp server .

we can login with anonymous credential. but i face some problem to list file dont know why this is happend. lets download all files recursively in ftp server.

`wget -r 'ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.10.113.63'`

we got `password-policy.md` and `ufw.status`.

*password-policy.md*

```
# Password Policy

## WebAnno

New passwords should be:

- lowercase
- between 12 and 14 characters long

```

password polycy used to set password. 


### HTTP

when we goto website `http://10.10.113.63` we provided a static web page.

![indexpage](/assets/thm/hamlet/indexpage.png)

here we got some usernames and email address.
`Michael`
`ghost`
`ghost@webanno.hamlet.thm`

Nothing more interested on this page.

### HTTP PORT 8000

This webpage only display the  `hamlet.txt`. but when we see source code of the page we get interesting endpoint.

`<iframe style="width:100%; height:100%" src="/repository/project/0/document/0/source/hamlet.txt"></iframe>`

I tried some ssrf and lfi payload here but doesn't succeed.


### HTTP PORT 8080

On port 8080 we get webanno login page. usually i dont try sql injection if web page is not custome build. I tried some common username:password pair but failed.

In ftp server get the password policy in file `password-policy.md`. and on port 80 we got `hamlet.txt` . so lets try to create password wordlist using this two things.

according to `password-policy.md` password shold be *lowercase* and 12 to 14 letters long.

here you can use tool like `cewl` but i just use the awk to filter word which is longer than 11 characters.

```
awk -F ' ' '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){ if(length($i)>=11) print $i }}' hamlet.txt > wordlist.lst

```

Now we have a list of user from port 80 index page. lets try to bruteforce password with hydra.

```
hydra -L user.txt -P wordlist.lst $ip -s 8080 http-post-form "/login.html?-1.-loginForm:urlfragment=&username=^^USER^
^&password=^^PASS^^:Login failed" -vV -t 1
```

keep in mind you have to reduce thread to 1 otherwise machine will crash or didn't show you result.

we got credential for : `g***t: v**********d`



## Gaining Access

Login into webanno using credentials.

I spend some time to check if we can levarage any functionality of webanno. after some enumeration and reading some webanno docs i found out that we can upload file for anotation.

so lets upload a php shell and figure how to execute that shell.

to upload a shell go to `project >> hamlet >> Documents` and upload php shell file.

Now we have to find a way to execute the shell.

In source code `http://10.10.113.63:8000/` we found `iframe` tag which include the hammer.txt file. same hammer.txt file we can see in hamlet annotation project. so lets try to execute php shell from `iframe` tag.

Open the dev tool and change the  `repository/project/0/document/0/source/hamlet.txt` to `repository/project/0/document/1/source/shell.php` and we get shell.

## Privilege Escalation

### Escalate from xxultimatecreeperxx to cybercrafted

After downloading `linpeas.sh` to the target machine and enumerating it for some time I find Minecraft server on the machine. 

this Minecraft server has a plugin called `loginsystem` which has a log file called `log.txt`. 

`/opt/mincraft/cybercrafted/plugins/LoginSystem/log.txt`

From this file, we get the password for `cybercrafted` user.


`cybercrafted:J*****************k`

Log in as `cybercrafted`.

Now we have a password for `cybercrafted`.

### Escalate from cybercrafted to root

Did some enumeration on the box and found out that `cybercrafted` can run `/usr/bin/screen` as root.

```
Matching Defaults entries for cybercrafted on cybercrafted:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User cybercrafted may run the following commands on cybercrafted:
    (root) /usr/bin/screen -r cybercrafted


```
`screen` is used to start a screen session or open any number of the window inside a session. 

`/usr/bin/screen -r cybercrafted` here `-r` used to resume the screen session of user `cybercrafted`.

After some research, I found out that we can create a new window with a shell using `screen`.

`sudo -u /usr/bin/screen -r cybercrafted`

it attaches the screen of `cybercrafted` .
then use shortcut `ctrl+a+c` and we get a root shell.

`ctrl+a+c` is used to create a new window with shell. and this program is running as root we get root window shell.
